🌐 Supply Chain Management dApp – My Blockchain Development Contribution

As part of my blockchain development journey, I designed and built a decentralized supply chain management dApp that leverages Ethereum smart contracts to ensure transparency, security, and traceability across the supply chain process.

🔹 Core Features I Developed:

Product Lifecycle Tracking – From manufacturer to distributor, retailer, and end-user, every stage of the product journey is recorded on-chain.

Immutable Records – Each transaction (production, shipping, delivery) is stored on the blockchain, making it tamper-proof and verifiable.

Smart Contract Automation – Deployed Solidity contracts to handle product registration, ownership transfer, and verification automatically.

Decentralized Verification – Stakeholders (manufacturers, suppliers, retailers, and customers) can validate product authenticity through unique IDs.

User-Friendly Frontend – Built using React.js + Ethers.js, enabling seamless interaction with the blockchain for both technical and non-technical users.

Wallet Integration – Integrated MetaMask for secure authentication and transaction signing.

🔹 Impact & Value:
This dApp enhances trust, efficiency, and transparency in the supply chain by reducing fraud, counterfeit products, and data manipulation. It provides a decentralized ecosystem where stakeholders can collaborate without depending on a central authority.

🔹 Tech Stack:

Blockchain: Ethereum (Solidity, Hardhat)

Frontend: React.js, Ethers.js

Storage: IPFS (for product documents & proofs)

Wallet: MetaMask integration

This project gave me hands-on experience in building real-world blockchain use cases, and it reflects my focus on creating scalable and impactful Web3 solutions.
